# Real estate market data exploration in Toulouse and its suburbs

The goal is to perform real estate data exploration near the city of Toulouse. We have access to a 5-years real data history of houses and apartments sales transactions in Toulouse and its suburbs. The dataset contains details for each transaction: sale date, localization (city, postalcode), type of residence, type of sale, land area, living area, number of rooms,price, etc.). We should use Spark for this analysis because we should be able to apply our analysis to a dataset with the entire real estate market in France for instance (bigdata file). Challenges here are to explore all possible aspects of this real estate market (variables, relationships between variables, trends, patterns, outliers, etc.). We should focus on at least 5 keys findings (tables or visualizations) and can explorefor instance:

The evolution of the prices (e.g. price per square meter)
Identification of sales outliers
Differences of prices per cities or postal codes
Differences between apartment and houses
Differences between types of sales
Differences between Toulouse and its suburbs
High cost, low cost or emerging cities
